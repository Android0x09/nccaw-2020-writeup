# Penetration Testing (50 points)

File(s): [fileList](fileList)

## Description:

Your pentest team has just infiltrated a client's corporate network and gained access to several hundred sensitive files located on an internal file server.

The files contain corporate secrets and have various values to the organization. Now, your team needs to copy the files out of the corporate network, but there's a problem. The corporation limits the amount of data that can be transferred out of the corporate network to 500 MB per day and today is the last day of the pentest engagement. Also, your team has already transferred 100 MB of data today before finding the sensitive files. There's not much time left and you need to make the most of it. Your paycheck will be much higher if you can copy the most valuable files out of the network.

Given a list of sensitive files, their values to the organization and the file sizes, determine the most valuable files that can be copied off the network by the end of the day. Your answer must be the maximum total sum of the file values (an integer value) that you are able to copy from the server.

[Don't guess - you only get 3 attempts!]
